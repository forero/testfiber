\begin{abstract}
In this document I show that fiberassign meets the desired performance in terms of fiber usage for science targets, calibration targets, sky-monitoring locations and Guide/Focus/Alignment targets.
\end{abstract}

{\texttt fiberassign} is the software that performs the assignment of
fibers to DESI targets. 

The following are the minimal requirements on its performance
\begin{itemize}
\item Fiber assignment uses required fraction of fibers IN.DAT-7002
\item Fiber assignment provides sufficient calibration fibers IN.DAT-7003

\end{itemize}
